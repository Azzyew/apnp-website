                <p>It was said that the poetic movement led by the Parnassians that had resulted in experimentation with metres and verse forms and the revival of the sonnet paralleled the trend toward realism in drama and the novel that became evident in the late 19th century. Initially they were taking their themes from contemporary society, but later turned to the mythology, epics, and sagas of exotic lands and past civilizations, notably India and ancient Greece. They had derived their name from the anthology to which they had contributed: Le Parnasse Contemporain (3 vol., 1866, 1871, 1876), which was said to have been edited by Louis-Xavier de Ricard and Catulle Mendès and published by Alphonse Lemerre. Their principles, though, had been formulated earlier in Théophile Gautier’s preface to Mademoiselle de Maupin (1835), which  had expounded the theory of art for art’s sake, in Leconte de Lisle’s preface to his Poèmes antiques (1852), and in La Revue Fantaisiste (1860), founded by Mendès. Gautier’s <i>Émaux et camées</i> (1852), a collection of carefully constructed, formally perfect poems, pointed to a new conception of poetry and influenced the works of major Parnassians such as Albert-Alexandre Glatigny, Théodore de Banville, François Coppée, Léon Dierx, and José Maria de Heredia. Heredia, the most representative of the group, had looked for precise details, double rhymes, sonorous words, and exotic names, and had concentrated on making the 14th line of his sonnets the most striking.</p>
